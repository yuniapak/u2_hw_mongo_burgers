Your friend is a culinary visionary and envisions that burgers can be made with any protein (beef, chicken, turkey, ostrich, tofu, emu, buffalo, elk, etc...), cheese is optional (only 1 slice of American cheese allowed) and the burger can have any number of toppings ( ketchup, mustard, guacamole, Worstershire sauce, french fries, hot fudge, mayonnaise, pickled beets, mango, sriracha, onions, ramen, pickles, capers, relish, fried banana and with peanut butter, olives, tabasco, kimchi, maple syrup, mushrooms, fried green tomatoes, etc.).
